# Click-Through Rate Prediction: Optimizing Ad Relevance with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project tackles the challenge of predicting click-through rates (CTR) for online advertisements, a crucial task for maximizing ad relevance and campaign ROI. Leveraging the large-scale Avazu CTR Prediction dataset (Kaggle), I developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models, exploring advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance predictive accuracy. The project demonstrates my proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation, key skills for a data scientist or machine learning engineer.

## Project Motivation

[**Target Audience:** Employers & Admissions Committees]

Driven by a strong interest in applying machine learning to real-world business challenges, I chose to focus on CTR prediction due to its significance in online advertising. This project allowed me to:

* **Develop Expertise:**  Gain hands-on experience with key machine learning techniques for classification, a common task in various domains.
* **Solve a Practical Problem:** Address a challenge faced by businesses across industries, demonstrating my ability to deliver practical solutions. 
* **Showcase Analytical Skills:**  Demonstrate my ability to analyze large datasets, extract meaningful insights, and communicate findings effectively.

## Dataset and Features

* **Dataset Source:** [Link to the Avazu CTR Prediction dataset on Kaggle]
* **Description:**  The Avazu dataset contains over 40 million records of ad impressions, each with 24 features encompassing user demographics, ad attributes, context information, and the target variable (click or no click).
* **Key Features:**
    * **User Features:** User agent, device type, operating system, geographic location.
    * **Ad Features:** Ad ID, advertiser ID, campaign ID, ad category.
    * **Context Features:**  Time of day, day of week, site ID, app ID.

## Methodology

### Data Exploration and Visualization

* **Initial Analysis:** Explored data distributions, identified missing values, and visualized key features to understand patterns and relationships.
* **[Include 1-2 compelling visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts) with concise captions explaining key insights gained from the data exploration.]**

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values using [state imputation method, e.g., mean/median/mode imputation] to ensure data integrity.
* **Categorical Feature Encoding:** Applied [state encoding method, e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding] to transform categorical features into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
* **Feature Scaling:** Standardized numerical features using [state scaling method, e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler] to prevent bias toward features with larger ranges.
* **Feature Engineering:** 
    * Engineered new features, such as [describe engineered features and their rationale], to potentially capture complex interactions and improve model accuracy.

### Model Selection and Training

* **Baseline Model:** Established a baseline performance using Logistic Regression, a simple yet interpretable model.
* **Advanced Models:**  Explored more sophisticated models, including:
    * **Tree-based Models:**  Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), known for their effectiveness in handling tabular data.
    * **[Optional: Neural Networks:**  If applicable, mention if you experimented with neural networks and the specific architectures used.]
* **Training:**  Split the data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets. Trained each model using the training set and tuned hyperparameters using the validation set to optimize performance.

### Model Evaluation and Selection

* **Evaluation Metrics:**  Selected appropriate metrics for CTR prediction:
    * **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):** Provides an overall measure of model performance, especially important for imbalanced datasets.
    * **Log Loss:**  Penalizes incorrect predictions more heavily, aligning with the goal of minimizing misclassifications.
    * **[Optional: Precision, Recall, F1-Score:**  If relevant, mention if you focused on specific outcomes like maximizing click prediction accuracy.]
* **Model Comparison:** Compared model performance on the held-out test set based on the chosen metrics, selecting the best model based on a balance of accuracy and interpretability.

## Results and Analysis
